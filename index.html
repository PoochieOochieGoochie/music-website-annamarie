            <p>
               Shawn Mendes is a Canadian pop singer and songwriter. After uploading a series of his cover versions to various video-sharing sites (beginning with the now-defunct application Vine in 2012), Mendes earned a dedicated following that he cultivated through social media outlets. His talent, teen-idol good looks and built-in fan base quickly landed him a record deal. In 2014 his debut single, "Life of the Party,” charted at No. 24 on the Billboard 100, making the then 15-year-old Mendes the youngest artist to have a debut song within the Top 25.
